The lecture of the week has introduced several applications of remote sensing and their policy challenges. The following content will focus on Singapore Climate Action contributing to the thermal environment and the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Besides, I will explore how to apply remote sensing data to respond to Singapore’s Climate Targets and their mitigation strategies. It is worth noting that the current methods based on remote sensing data are mainly limited to the monitoring and analysis of the real situation. How to use this data for prevention strategies needs further research.

## 1.1 Background: Thermal environment in Singapore{.unnumbered}

Affected by major global climate changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions, Singapore's annual average temperature rose from 26.9°C to 28.0°C from 1980 to 2020; Moreover, by 2100, the temperature will rise by 1.4°C to 4.6°C due to the long-term effects of climate change (The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), no date).

However, the UHI effect exacerbates the problem of high temperatures  and it is considered as one of the accumulated results of rapid urbanisation in Singapore(Borzino et al., 2020). Heat island effect is a phenomenon that urban areas have a higher temperature than the surrounding area (Oke,1982). The primary reasons for the UHI effect is the greater heat storage due to land use change from natural to impervious surface(Grimmond, 2007). Besides, With the rise in urban population, the increases of building density and human activities also create more energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions(Zhang et al., 2021). In the terms of Singapore, daytime temperatures are around 0-2°C higher and night-time temperatures are around 2-4°C higher in urban areas compared to forested areas(Figure 1) (Urban Redevelopment Authority(URA),2023). The warmer climate has adverse impacts on biodiversity, public health, food security, energy consumption and other aspects, resulting in a unsustainable future in Singapore.

## 1.2 Singapore’s Climate Targets {.unnumbered}

**Charting Singapore’s Net Zero Future**

Singapore has proposed the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) in response to their climate ambitions.In October 2022, the national climate target was further raised as follows:

1. Achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
2. Reduce 2030 emissions to 60 MtCO2e after peaking emissions earlier.

## 1.3 Policies Related to UHI {.unnumbered}

To achieve net zero emission by 2050 and sustainable development, Singapore has launched some thrusts. The below sections will explore some policies and strategies related to mitigating the UHI effect.

**The Singapore Green Plan 2030**

Launched in February 2021, The Singapore Green Plan 2030 has proposed 5 pillars for sustainable development, including City in Nature, Energy Reset, Sustainable Living, Green Economy and Resilient Future, indicated in Figure 2.

In the section of Resilient Future, Keeping Singapore cool is emphasised to mitigate the rise in urban heat, and the key strategies proposed by Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and URA (no date) are as follows:

* **Understanding the UHI Effect** 

  * Deploying an island-wide network of climate sensors to collect data. 
  * Establishing models to simulate future climatic scenarios and the microclimates of built-up area.

* **Conducting Research on the Effectiveness of UHI Mitigation Strategies**

  * The research projects, such as ‘Cooling Singapore 2.0’, will help policymakers to assess the effectiveness of various strategies to moderate the UHI effect.

* **Implementing UHI Mitigation Measures**

  The research findings and insights will provide mitigation measures for the UHI effect.The existing interim measures are:
  
  * Increasing greenery provision in existing built-up areas.
  * Optimising building layouts to maximise natural ventilation and shade.
  * Adopting ‘cool materials’ on buildings.
  * Promoting HDB Green Towns programmes
  * ……
