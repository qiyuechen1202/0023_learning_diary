The lecture of the week has introduced several applications of remote sensing and their policy challenges. The following content will focus on Singapore Climate Action contributing to the thermal environment and the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Besides, I will explore how to apply remote sensing data to respond to Singapore's Climate Targets and their mitigation strategies. It is worth noting that the current methods based on remote sensing data are mainly limited to the monitoring and analysis of the real situation. How to use this data for prevention strategies needs further research.

# 1.Content Summary: Policy Challenge {.unnumbered}

## 1.1 Background: Thermal environment in Singapore {.unnumbered}

Affected by major global climate changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions, Singapore's annual average temperature rose from 26.9°C to 28.0°C from 1980 to 2020; Moreover, by 2100, the temperature will rise by 1.4°C to 4.6°C due to the long-term effects of climate change (The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), no date).

However, the UHI effect exacerbates the problem of high temperatures and it is considered as one of the accumulated results of rapid urbanisation in Singapore(Borzino et al., 2020). Heat island effect is a phenomenon that urban areas have a higher temperature than the surrounding area (Oke,1982). The primary reasons for the UHI effect is the greater heat storage due to land use change from natural to impervious surface(Grimmond, 2007). Besides, With the rise in urban population, the increases of building density and human activities also create more energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions(Zhang et al., 2021). In the terms of Singapore, daytime temperatures are around 0-2°C higher and night-time temperatures are around 2-4°C higher in urban areas compared to forested areas(Figure 1) (Urban Redevelopment Authority(URA),2023). The warmer climate has adverse impacts on biodiversity, public health, food security, energy consumption and other aspects, resulting in a unsustainable future in Singapore.

## 1.2 Singapore's Climate Targets {.unnumbered}

**Charting Singapore's Net Zero Future**

Singapore has proposed the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) in response to their climate ambitions.In October 2022, the national climate target was further raised as follows:

1.  Achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
2.  Reduce 2030 emissions to 60 MtCO2e after peaking emissions earlier.

## 1.3 Policies Related to UHI {.unnumbered}

To achieve net zero emission by 2050 and sustainable development, Singapore has launched some thrusts. The below sections will explore some policies and strategies related to mitigating the UHI effect.

**The Singapore Green Plan 2030**

Launched in February 2021, The Singapore Green Plan 2030 has proposed 5 pillars for sustainable development, including City in Nature, Energy Reset, Sustainable Living, Green Economy and Resilient Future, indicated in Figure 2.

![Figure 2 The Content of Singapore Green Plan 2030. Picture source from [The Singapore Green Plan 2030](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/cos/)](source/week04/cos-sgp-infographics.png)

In the section of Resilient Future, Keeping Singapore cool is emphasised to mitigate the rise in urban heat, and the key strategies proposed by Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and URA (no date) are as follows:

-   **Understanding the UHI Effect**

    -   Deploying an island-wide network of climate sensors to collect data.
    -   Establishing models to simulate future climatic scenarios and the microclimates of built-up area.

-   **Conducting Research on the Effectiveness of UHI Mitigation Strategies**

    -   The research projects, such as 'Cooling Singapore 2.0', will help policymakers to assess the effectiveness of various strategies to moderate the UHI effect.

-   **Implementing UHI Mitigation Measures**

    The research findings and insights will provide mitigation measures for the UHI effect.The existing interim measures are:

    -   Increasing greenery provision in existing built-up areas.
    -   Optimising building layouts to maximise natural ventilation and shade.
    -   Adopting 'cool materials' on buildings.
    -   Promoting HDB Green Towns programmes
    -   ......

# 2.Application {.unnumbered}

Earth observation data on UHI has been widely discussed and its application can provide vital information to understand and address the challenges posed by UHI. Corresponding to Singapore cooling strategy, the section will introduce the mitigation strategies related to remotely sensed data from two perspectives, namely urban morphology and building roofs.

## 2.1 Urban Morphology: Local Climate Zones (LCZs) {.unnumbered}

The mitigation measures of UHI effect have been discussed with urban form. The Local climate zone (LCZ) introduced by Stewart and Oke(2012) provides a new classification system of urban structure,which can be applied to detect local climate changes. By using machine learning to identify and classify urban satellite images,LCZs are categorised into 17 classes, namely 10 urban classes and 7 natural classes (Figure 3). The classification criteria are diverse and can be adjusted according to the geographical characteristics of the study area. Based on the summary of Stewart and Oke(2012) the classification criteria mainly include 4 aspects, as shown in Figure 4.

![Figure 3 The Classification of Local Climate Zones (Source from Bechtel,et al.(2017) and Stewart and Oke(2012))](source/week04/LCZ_classification.jpg)

![Figure 4 The Classification Criteria of Local Climate Zones (Source from Stewart and Oke(2012))](source/week04/classification_criteria.png)

The heat island effect on LCZs is mainly examined by combining the Land Surface Temperature(LST), which can be reflected in the research of authors Yang et al.(2021) and Xu et al.(2022). Initially, remote sensing data were distinguished using classification indicators, and machine learning methods were applied for supervised classification of remote sensing images to discern various categories of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) （Figure 5). Subsequently, the authors acquired LST data through processing remote sensing dataset and analysed the differentiated LST displayed by different types of LCZs.

![Figure 5 The RS-based LCZs Map of Guangzhou City (Source from Xu et al.(2022))](source/week04/RS_Based_LCZ.png)

Based on the analysis of summer average LST in Liaoning Province, China (Figure 6), Yang et al.(2021) proposed that LCZE (bare rock and paved) are more likely to increase LST, while LCZA(Dense trees) and LCZG(water) are more likely to decrease LST, aligning with the study of Guangzhou by Xu et al. (2022). In addition, regarding the urban classes of LCZs, Yang et al. (2022) suggested that higher numbers of summer LSTs occur in LCZ 2(compact mid-rise) and LCZ10(heavy industry).On the contrary, Xu et al.(2022) indicated that LCZ 3 (compact low-rise) and LCZ 8 (large low-rise) are the areas with the most severe thermal impact, further proving that there is heterogeneity in the effect of urban space on LST.

![Figure 6 The LCZs box plot with LST in Liaoning Province,China, 2017 and 2019(Source from Yang et al.(2021))](source/week04/Box_plots.png)

To promote green town programmes, Singapore can adopt LCZs to identify the urban morphology with higher and lower thermal impact and conduct urban regeneration. Moreover, the LCZs method can also be applied to long-term monitoring for seasons, which can further propose prevention strategies for thermal impacts.

## 2.2 "Cooling" Roofs {.unnumbered}

Given the high density and urbanisation rate in Singapore, making significant changes to the existing built environment is challenging. Thus, the adoption of "cooling" roofs has been recognized as a crucial strategy to address UHI effect in Singapore. Considering the significant influence of surface albedo on UHI, some scholars have explored solar reflective materials to alleviate this phenomenon (Despini et al., 2021). Using LANDSAT images of Chicago to compare albedo and Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), Mackey, Lee and Smith (2012) suggested that the reflective roofs show a more effective cooling effect than green items, such as green roofs, green spaces, and street trees. Besides, Taking the Municipality of Modena as a study area, Despini et al.( 2020) employed WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite images to obtain Surface Reflectance (SR) to calculate the average SR of different urban surfaces (Figure 7). Based on scenario predictions, the authors mentioned that the average temperature decreases by 1.2°C when cool materials on building roofs and cool coloured coatings on streets and parkings are applied.

![Figure7 The example of RGB images (left) and Albedo images(right) in Modena (source form Despini et al. (2021)](source/week04/application_2_0.jpg)

Moreover, Mushore, Odindi and Mutanga (2022) examine the colour of roof coating by adopting Sentinel 2 and Landsat images. They distinguish the roof colour and then discuss their thermal effect in a low-density residential area of Zimbabwe, Harare. Figure 8 displays their outcomes, and Figure 8(b) indicates that the coolest roofs were blue and the warmest roofs were green and red. Overall, the studies cited above employed remote sensing data to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures on building roofs, which can be used to address the UHI effect in Singapore.
