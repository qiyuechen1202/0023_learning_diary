# 1. Content Summary: Corrections {.unnumbered}

This week, I have learned the preprocessing steps of remote sensing images. When transmitting and acquiring remote sensing images, we may encounter various interferences, such as sensor noise, atmospheric disturbance, terrain effects, etc, which affect the accuracy and usability of the images. Therefore, the pre-processing steps are essential to improve the image quality, providing a more reliable data basis for subsequent analysis. There are two preprocessing steps: (1) Corrections and (2) Data joining and enhancement.

## 1.1 Corrections {.unnumbered}

The following mind map summarises the knowledge of four correction methods, including Geometric, Atmospheric correction, Topographic and Radiometric correction, and focuses on the reasons and methods for using correction methods.

## 1.2 Data Joining and Enhancement {.unnumbered}

### 1.2.1 Data Joining {.unnumbered}

Image data can be joined by overlapping the base and second image by 20% \~30%. According to Jensen (2015), the joining steps are:

1.  **Sample Selection**: <br/> Select a representative sample within the overlapping area.
2.  **Histogram Extraction**: <br/> Extract a histogram from the base image.
3.  **Histogram Matching**: <br/> Apply a histogram matching algorithm to the image, which can give similar brightness values of the two images.
4.  **Edge Feathering**: <br/> Conduct edge feathering to seamlessly blend the images.

## !! NOTE!! Some Solutions

When we may have problems joining different images (typically in surface reflectance products), some solutions are as follows:

-   To Conduct Standardisation (dividing the SR value by a maximum value per band) and Normalisation (dividing the standardised value by the sum of values across all bands) for each image.
-   Further apply relative radiometric normalisation.
-   Classify each image alone.
-   Calculate other metrics from the image.

### 1.2.2 Image enhancement {.unnumbered}

-   The Methods of **Contrast Enhancement**

    -   Minimum - Maximum
    -   Percentage Linear and Standard Deviation
    -   Piecewise Linear Contrast Stretch

-   **Other Enhancement**

    -   **Ratio** (e.g. Normalised Burn Ratio)
    -   **Filter** (e,g. Edge enhancement, to change in pixel values.)
    -   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Transform multi-spectral data into uncorrelated and smaller dataset.
    -   **Texture**ï¼›Spatial variation of grey values. (e.g. gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs))
    -   **Fusion**: Where data from multiple sensors/sources is fused together.

# 2. Application {.unnumbered}

The pre-processing step of remote sensing plays an important role in data quality, and the section will take the study of Deng et al.(2019) as an example to understand the application of pre-processing technologies mentioned in the lecture.

Deng et al.(2019) adopted a sequence of multi-sensor SPOT images and Sentiel-2A data to monitor the urban expansion and green space dynamics in Hangzhou City, China, from 1996 to 2016.

-   **Topographic Correction**

Firstly, the authors adopted a topographic correction based on the collinearity equation to remove geometric distortion. The method took the digital orthorectified map (DOM) as the reference image and employed digital elevation model (DEM) and sensor position information to further support the step. The accuracy of correction results was further examined by RSME, and all were lower than 0.5.

-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

To improve classification accuracy, the authors used PCA to distinguish different principal components from the merged multip-date data, which can enhance the ability to capture change information. As shown in Figure 2, the change objects were extracted and highlighted in PC 3 (g), showing the land use change from cropland to urban land. The PCA provided a reliable basis for subsequent results of land classification.

This application further supports Munyati's (2004) argument that PCA has advantages in detecting changes. However, Deng et al.(2006) also indicated the weaknesses of PCA:

1.  The results of PCA are affected by the difference between the multi-sensor and multi-date data.

2.  Aa a scene dependent technique, PCA results often suffer from large heterogeneity, requiring a strong support form expert knowledge.
