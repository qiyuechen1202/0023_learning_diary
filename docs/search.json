Exciting is the potential synergy between remote sensing data and socioeconomic indicators, presenting an avenue for exploring spatial heterogeneity. It may be included in my future research. However, the drawbacks also suggest that as a researcher of urban studies, I need to think carefully when using this data. This entails thoughtful decisions regarding selecting remote sensing data, processing methods, analytical approaches, and result interpretation.\nMy previous studies focused on applying Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with vector data. Over the next few weeks, exploring the knowledge of remote sensing will allow me to integrate these two technologies, which can enhance my ability in data acquisition and spatial analysis. I look forward to learning about remote sensing in the coming weeks. :)"

    "text": "1. Content Summary: Google Earth Engine (GEE)\nGEE provides an opportunity for large-scale geospatial analysis, and has found extensive application. A study examining 450 GEE articles by Amani et al.(2020) summarised the primary scope of GEE applications (Figure 5), indicating that the GEE platform is mainly utilised in the fields of vegetation, agriculture, and hydrology category.\nIn terms of dataset application, Tamiminia et al. (2020) demonstrated, in a systematic review of 348 GEE articles, that 90% of GEE research adopted remote sensing datasets and conducted a series of Machine Learning, including classification, regression, and other methods (e.g. feature extraction) (Figure 6). The findings also revealed that Landsat (especially Landsat 8) and MODIS, as optical imagery with medium spatial resolution, were most popular in GEE studies. Taking the study of Xie et al. (2019) as an example, the time-series Landsat dataset was adopted on the GEE platform to monitor vegetation dynamics by calculating indices, and the GEE application significantly reduced the time and effort spent on data access, processing, and its storage cost. Xie et al.(2019) further mentioned that GEE can contribute to the efficient collaboration and sharing of scripts, allowing scholars to apply codes and access results easily and freely. Additionally, Tamiminia et al. (2020) also revealed that 10% of GEE studies analysed ready-to-use products, mainly focusing on vegetation indices, land cover, Hansen global forest change, and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). For instance, to capture cropland mapping of Africa, Xiong et al. (2017) applied the 16-day time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI composited data at 250-m resolution to develop the algorithm on the GEE platform.\nThis is my first experience using GEE. It is undeniable that its usability is very powerful. Compared with SNAP and R studio, it provides a variety of online data sources and saves a lot of time in image processing. Although I have no experience with Javascript, I can learn and apply code through the function library it provides. I guess this is why I need to learn GEE!\nNevertheless, I also recognise that GEE has some limitations in its application. GEE is a web-based platform, which requires me to use it under a constant Internet connection. This might pose challenges for users in areas with poor or no internet access. Besides, Amani et al. (2020) summarised some limitations of GEE, including incomplete support for algorithms (e.g., unavailability of deep learning algorithms) and the need for improvement in efficiency and accuracy of image segmentation algorithms for classification.\nHence, in GEE for image processing, I should experiment with and delve into multiple algorithms. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the differences among these algorithms, I can strategically choose the most fitting one for computation. This exploration might serve as a potential direction for my future learning and development."

European Space Agency(ESA) has proposed the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission to observe earth by recording the wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imagery. The Sentinel-2 captures 13 spectral bands with different spatial resolutions.\nTo explore the features of spectral bands and their combinations, the data is resampled to 20m by considering the neighbouring pixels.

Similar to Colour Infrared, B8 is employed to monitor vegetation health. Combined with shortwave Infrared band (B11) being sensitive to moisture, this combination is beneficial to monitoring vegetation. Thus, the figure displays healthier and more hydrated vegetation with more bright green. In addition to vegetation, B11 also provides information about surface features. It mainly reflects that the bare soil area in the northeast corner of Cape Town reflects a slight red element. Moreover, the urbanised area appears blue."

    "section": "2.1 Advantages",
    "text": "2.1 Advantages\nBased on its features of wide area coverage and repeated cycles, remote sensing can measure a regional or continental scale of urban environmental conditions and quantify changes in those conditions over time. The primary focus of this application lies in studying urban land cover and land use changes. The application is evident in the study of Wang et al.(2012), who adopted the Landsat TM/ETM+ to track China’s urban expansion from 1990 to 2010. Similarly, Zhou et al.(2018) explored the global urban dynamics from 1992 to 2013 using nighttime light (NTL) observations from DMSP/OLS. Furthermore, the Landsat dataset was also employed by Wang(2020) to predict land use and land cover changes in Kathmandu, Nepal. These studies underscore the feasibility of remote sensing for studying changes in land use and land cover at wide temporal and geographical scales.\nSecondly, remote sensing provides high-resolution imagery data, which is conducive to effectively identifying the elements of urban environments. The application is evident in the study of Qian et al.(2015), which examines the spatial pattern of green space and its changes in Beijing using satellite images with 2.5m spatial resolution, as shown in Figure(4). In addition, the QuickBird satellite provided very high-resolution imagery to the study of Kit, Lüdeke and Reckien(2012), which was employed to identify urban slums in Hyderabad, India.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Land cover classifications in 2005 and 2009. (source from Qian et al.,2015)\n\n\n\nThe images from 2005 and 2009 were obtained from Systeme Probatoire d’Observation dela Tarre(SPOT-5) and Advanced Land Observation Satellite(ALOS), respectively. The images were reprocessed to obtain multispectral images with 2.5 m spatial resolution.\n\nThere are two examples of the application in terms of observing human activities. Based on the two advantages mentioned above, remote sensing is considered as a supplementary tool for demographic, socioeconomic, and health investigations that are constrained in their geographical scope (Zhu et al., 2019). Regarding the social equity aspect, Kuffer et al. (2018) reported the disparity in access to street lighting between non-deprived built-up areas and slums by using NTL images and slum boundary data. In terms of public health, the Landsat-8 dataset and demographic distribution data were employed to assess the impact of urban heat islands on human health (Sagris and Sepp, 2017)."

    "text": "2.2 Disadvantages\nAlthough the advantages of remote sensing prove that it can be widely used in urban research, there are still drawbacks in its application. In their study of slums, Mahabir et al. (2018) state that remote sensing data can be used to identify the physical features of environments, while it is difficult to capture the characteristics of socioeconomic and cultural aspects. Thus, capturing a holistic understanding by integrating remote sensing data and socio-cultural datasets is essential. Besides, Bianchetti and MacEachren (2015) mentioned a misunderstanding that remote sensing images authoritatively and objectively represent the real world. However, the interpretation of remote sensing images requires analysts to draw on their knowledge, experience, and cognitive processes to obtain insights from the visual clues in the images, revealing the nature of subjectivity (White, 2019). Although scholars have adopted machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to interpret and classify remote sensing images, the complexity of this process has become a significant obstacle in its application to urban studies."

The primary reason for the UHI effect is the greater heat storage due to land use change from natural to impervious surface(Grimmond, 2007). Besides, With the rise in urban population, the increases in building density and human activities also create more energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions(Zhang et al., 2021). In terms of Singapore, daytime temperatures are around 0-2°C higher, and night-time temperatures are around 2-4°C higher in urban areas compared to forested areas(Figure 1) (Urban Redevelopment Authority(URA),2023). The warmer climate has adverse impacts on biodiversity, public health, food security, energy consumption and other aspects, resulting in an unsustainable future in Singapore.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 The urban heat island effect in Singapor.

The studies of urban morphology (LCZs) can monitor the thermal environment and support HDB Green Towns programmes, contributing to sustainable urban regeneration in the future. Given Singapore’s high-density built-up areas, it is difficult to adopt a large-scale strategy. Thus, “Cooling” roofs, as an “acupuncture” strategy, can effectively mitigate the local thermal environment, and reduce building temperature and energy consumption. Overall, these two strategies solve the UHI effect from different urban scales, and effective application and deployment are conducive to achieving “Cooling” Singapore.\nRegarding global agendas and goals, the policy and strategies effectively respond to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Moreover, In terms of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) proposed by the United Nations(UN), the efforts of strategies can be reflected in SDG11 and SDG12 (Figure 9).\n SDGs11:Sustainable Cities and Communities.

When transmitting and acquiring remote sensing images, we may encounter various interferences, such as sensor noise, atmospheric disturbance, terrain effects, etc, which affect the accuracy and usability of the images. Therefore, the pre-processing steps are essential to improve the image quality, providing a more reliable data basis for subsequent analysis. There are two preprocessing steps: (1) Corrections and (2) Data joining and enhancement.\nThe pre-processing step of remote sensing plays an important role in data quality, and the section will take the study of Deng et al.(2019) as an example to understand the application of pre-processing technologies mentioned in the lecture.\nDeng et al.(2019) adopted a sequence of multi-sensor SPOT images and Sentiel-2A data to monitor the urban expansion and green space dynamics in Hangzhou City, China, from 1996 to 2016.\nFirstly, the authors adopted a topographic correction based on the collinearity equation to remove geometric distortion. The method took the digital orthorectified map (DOM) as the reference image and employed digital elevation model (DEM) and sensor position information to further support the step. The accuracy of correction results was further examined by RSME, and all were lower than 0.5.\nTo improve classification accuracy, the authors used PCA to distinguish different principal components from the merged multip-date data, which can enhance the ability to capture change information. As shown in Figure 2, the change objects were extracted and highlighted in PC 3 (g), showing the land use change from cropland to urban land. The PCA provided a reliable basis for subsequent results of land classification.\nThis application further supports Munyati’s (2004) argument that PCA has advantages in detecting changes. However, Deng et al.(2006) also indicated the weaknesses of PCA:\nThe content this week is challenging for me as a beginner in remote sensing. However, these preprocessing techniques are crucial for improving the usability and accuracy of remote sensing data. Fortunately, we now have access to Level-2 products, but understanding their preprocessing steps is vital, especially in dealing with some error values, which can better explain why the errors occur. It is also crucial to select appropriate correction methods and enhancement techniques tailored to different sensor data features and analysis objectives. These processes require rich expert knowledge of remote sensing. Thus, I need to supplement my remote sensing knowledge to support my judgments further."

    "text": "1. Content Summary: Classification Ⅰ\nThe application of machine learning in remote sensing classification is crucial, due to its efficiency in extracting various features from the imagery datasets. Considering the study at large geographical scales, manual processing is prone to errors and time-consuming. Machine learning effectively addresses the challenges by automating tasks and obtaining highly accurate results, which can improve efficiency and reduce human intervention. Its application has notably accelerated the progress of remote sensing research, particularly in large geographical areas, being utilised for tasks like land cover classification and extracting features such as urban green space and forest fires.\nHowever, it is worth noting that machine learning methods are diverse and demonstrate varied results in their applications. Therefore, understanding these machine learning methods is crucial for our application in remote sensing research. Next, in terms of the methods of image classification, I will review the supervised classification and unsupervised classification methods mentioned in the lecture.\nGISGeography(2023) summarised the definitions of supervised and unsupervised classification and the differences between them, as shown in Tbale 1.\nThere are various classifiers for remote sensing data. Understanding the applications of these methods in previous studies and their accurate performance can help me further understand these classifiers. Based on a review of previous literature, Tamiminia et al.(2020) indicated that the most popular classifier was RF (49%), and the following are CART(13%) and SVM (11%). Figure 4 illustrates the accuracy performance of different classifiers, showing that all classifiers show a mean accuracy greater than 85%. Besides, the Decision Tree (DT) shows the best accuracy performance as the highest mean value, followed by CART. However, it is notable that RF demonstrates a greater variance in the mean value. Tamiminia et al. (2020) explained that, in some instances, this may be due to the low amount of training data that leads to misclassification.\nIn terms of the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) mentioned in the Week04 Application, previous studies employed multiple classifiers of supervised classification, such as maximum likelihood (Xu et al., 2022), convolutional neural network (CNN) (zhou et al., 2021), and RF (Chen et al., 2021, Danylo et al., 2016)). Taking the study of Chen et al.(2021) as an example, the following introduces the LCZ classification using RF. Chen et al.(2021) adopted the Sentiel-2 Level-2A product to classify the central part of Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, China, into 13 LCZ classes. The training data with 46,542 pixels and test data with 14,569 pixels were independently selected and spatially dispersed. Then, spectral, textural, and polarimetric features are inputted in RF classification, and Figure 5 shows the classification result. Although the differential accuracies are illustrated in different types of LCZ(Table 2), the overall accuracy result is 89.55%, performing the acceptable results. Overall, the application is a typical example of supervised classification steps, which provides deep insights for exploring supervised classification. The steps of supervised classification are complicated, requiring a large dataset and carefully designing and improving the workflow to improve the accuracy performance.\nIn my undergraduate studies in urban planning and design, I often encountered limitations due to a lack of data, making it difficult to conduct large-scale urban research. For example, during the urban design course project on Bali island, I encountered significant difficulties due to the unavailability of detailed urban land cover data. However, through this week’s study, I have learned various classifiers for remote sensing image classification, and realised that machine learning could help urban planners identify and generate large-scale data, thus providing more possibilities for large-scale analysis of cities or regions. Furthermore, applying these classifiers can also assist me in delving deeper into the methods mentioned in week 04 for mitigating the urban heat island effect, such as LCZs and “Cooling” Roofs, demonstrating their broad applicability in practice.\nHowever, I also recognise that the choice of classifiers and procedure dramatically affects the accuracy performance. When I input the training set into GEE, the limited number of training samples and inaccurate delineation of land cover polygons resulted in issues with the final classification results. Therefore, in future applications, it is essential to improve the procedures and the quality of training samples, which can improve the accuracy and reliability of the classification results."

    "text": "2.2 “Cooling” Roofs\nGiven the high density and urbanisation rate in Singapore, making significant changes to the existing built environment is challenging. Thus, the adoption of “cooling” roofs has been recognized as a crucial strategy to address the UHI effect in Singapore. Considering the significant influence of surface albedo on UHI, some scholars have explored solar reflective materials to alleviate this phenomenon (Despini et al., 2021). Using LANDSAT images of Chicago to compare albedo and Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), Mackey, Lee and Smith (2012) suggested that reflective roofs show a more effective cooling effect than green items, such as green roofs, green spaces, and street trees. Besides, Taking the Municipality of Modena as a study area, Despini et al.( 2020) employed WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite images to obtain Surface Reflectance (SR) to calculate the average SR of different urban surfaces (Figure 1). Based on scenario predictions, the authors mentioned that the average temperature decreases by 1.2°C when cool materials on building roofs and cool coloured coatings on streets and parkings are applied.\n\n\n\nFigure7 The example of RGB images (left) and Albedo images(right) in Modena (source form Despini et al. (2021)\n\n\nMoreover, Mushore, Odindi and Mutanga (2022) examine the colour of roof coating by adopting Sentinel 2 and Landsat images. They distinguish the roof colour and then discuss their thermal effect in a low-density residential area of Zimbabwe, Harare. Figure 8 displays their outcomes, and Figure 8(b) indicates that the coolest roofs were blue and the warmest roofs were green and red. Overall, the studies cited above employed remote sensing data to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures on building roofs, which can be used to address the UHI effect in Singapore.\n\n\n\nFigure 8 Research results on low-density residential areas in Zimbabwe.(a)The land use and land cover map (left) and roof colour map (right).

Set its parameters if necessary.\nTraining: Train the classifier using the training data.\nPixel Assignment: Classify an image or feature collection.\nAccuracy Assessment: Estimate classification error with independent validation data. \n\n\n\n1.2.2 The Classifiers\nThe common unsupervised image algorithms are:\n\nClassification and Regression Tree (CART)\n\nCART is a tree-based framework and consists of classification trees and regression trees. It can be used to divide the dataset into subsets as a tree structure, which can capture different classes (for classification)and predict the value (for regression). Its application can capture patterns and regularities in data sets to maximise the homogeneity or similarity within each group, making the results more accurate. Gini impurity (for classification) and SME(Squared Mean Error, for regression ) in CART serve as criteria for classifying the subset aiming to minimise impurity or error of resulting subsets. In Figure 1, RESEDA(no date) provides a tree-structure example for CART applied for Land classification, which can help me to understand the processing.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 The land classification process of CART. Source from RESEDA(no date)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of CART\n\n\n\n\n\nReferring to the similar content of CASA0006, the advantages and disadvantages of CART are summarised as follows:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nInterpretability : relatively easy to understand (compared to many trees).\nFlexibility : no assumptions of data distribution and no transformations needed. \n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLack of smoothness : slight changes in the predicators can have a big impact on the response.\nTendency of overfitting : meaning that the tree fits well to the training data but is unable to generalise to new data. Thus, it is essential to cut the tree levels to improve the generalisation ability of CART (Lawrence and Wright, 2001) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Forest (RF)\n\nRF is an ensemble classifier that consists of many CARTs. Based on the summary of Aziz et al. (2024), the RF workflow (Figure 2) for land classification includes: (1) Random Forests operate on a given dataset with N records(the number of samples) and K outputs (the number of classes);(2) The RF model creates decision trees for each set of samples to produce the output;(3) the final output is determined by assigning greater importance to the majority of votes.\nAfter the training phase, the RF model becomes adept at making predictions or inferences on new, unseen data. The final result provides distinct labels representing different land types, showcasing its ability to generalise and classify land use with flexibility and accuracy.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 The Workflow of RF. Source from Bhatnagar, Gill and Ghosh (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of RF\n\n\n\n\n\nReferring to the similar content of CASA0006, the advantages and disadvantages of RF are summarised as follows:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nNo assumptions on data distribution.\nAble to model non-linear relationship and feature interactions.\nGood predictive performance (especially for tabular data).\nGood generalisation.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLow interpretability: not intuitive, although there are some interpretation methods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Classifiers\n\nIn addition to CART and RF, the following classifiers were introduced in the lecture. Although their definition and applications are a bit complicated for me, they are very interesting and offer more possibilities for image classification. I hope to deepen my understanding of them in future studies.\n\nMaximum Likelihood:\n\nThe maximum likelihood is a decision rule classifier. It assigns pixels in an image to different landcover classes based on their spectral characteristics, using probabilities and decision rules (MacLachlan, 2024). The goal is to maximise the likelihood of observed pixel values given class statistics. The advantages of the classifier are simple and robust enough to accommodate large datasets and modifications (Manuel Núñez et al., 2019).\n\nSupport Vector Machines(SVM):\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, SVM is a linear binary classifier - like logistic regression(MacLachlan, 2024). The algorithm can be used for linearly and nonlinearly separable data, which primarily work for classification problems (Srivastava, 2021). Based on the collection of labelled data instances, the SVM training algorithm endeavours to identify a hyperplane that divides the dataset into a distinct, pre-defined number of classes in accordance with the patterns observed in the training examples (Vapnik, 2006).\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Linear support vector machine classifier .

The development of remote sensing classification algorithms is rapid, and object-based methods provide a new approach to classification. In urban planning, OBIA can be used to obtain data such as building distribution and transportation network layout. The vector data can be further integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial analysis and visualization, enhancing the understanding and utilisation of geographic information. Additionally, these vector data can be integrated with geographic datasets in GIS to further enrich GIS databases, supporting planners in management and decision-making.\nWith the continuous advancement of classification technology, remote sensing data has demonstrated strong potential in geospatial data acquisition and analysis. In the future, it can be further innovated to obtain more accurate classification data while also enhancing data availability. However, when utilising real-world remote sensing data for classification, various issues may arise (such as spatial autocorrelation), which affects the accuracy. This highlights the importance of having sufficient remote sensing knowledge to assess and address these challenges. Therefore, the accurate acquisition of remote sensing data not only relies on the development of technical tools but also requires professionals to continuously accumulate experience and improve methods to overcome various challenges that may arise during the classification process."

    "text": "1. Content Summary: Temperature\nBased on my discussion on heat island effect issues and policies in Singapore in week04, I found that remote sensing data has advantages in discussing heat mitigation measures. This week we will further practice using Landsat 8 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset to obtain Land Surface Temperature (LST) to discover how temperatures change with geographic space in Singapore.Figure 1 shows the region map of Singapore. In the section, satellite images from May to July 2021 are selected for analysis.\nBased on this week’s practice of collecting LST using remote sensing data, I found that remote sensing satellite data has certain limitations when used. LST data with high spatial and temporal resolution are not available concurrently due to the mutual constraints of spatial and temporal resolution (Li et al., 2021). Landsat 8 with high spatial resolution and MODIS with high temporal resolution indicate complementary features, which can improve LST retrieval(Zhao et al., 2020). Thus, scholars have explored various applications of MODIS and LST to improve the quality of LST data.\nBased on the characteristics of satellite images, Sidiqui, Huete and Devadas (2016) analysed time series of UHI intensity in Sydney using MODIS LST data, which could obtain the global characteristics of UHI; and then the Landsat 8 LST data was employed to capture the hot spot locations of UHI more clearly. In addition, some scholars have developed high-spatiotemporal-resolution LST data from a technical perspective. Data Fusion of MODIS and Landsat 8 is an effective method to improve the two resolutions of LST data(Zhao et al., 2020). Data fusion with multi-sensor refers to combining two or more calibrated images into a single one that has the best features of both (Ghassemian, 2016). To increase the quality of LST data, various models have been provided to merge the Landsat 8 LST data and MODIS LST data (Li et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2020; and Yang et al., 2020), such as the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF) proposed by Yang et al., (2020)and Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) proposed by Li et al.(2021). By comparing the original LST data and the ground measurements LST, the LST data generated by these models all reflect relatively good feasibility and accuracy. The combined LST data can capture the spatial pattern from Landsat 8 and also retain the temporal information from MODIS LST. Overall, this is an interesting research direction that can combine the advantages of sensors, while it also requires complex and interdisciplinary expert knowledge.\nCapturing the LST data by myself is an exciting process, although some problems affect the availability of final results. Besides, using GEE to calculate LST is more effective and time-saving, significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, due to the limitations of current remote sensing datasets, the application section explored the various data fusion methods, providing a research direction that combines deep learning methods and multi-sensor data to enhance the resolution of LST results.\nHowever, it is worth noting that LST is spatial heterogeneity but also may be affected by spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, future research can explore how to more accurately reflect the spatial distribution of LST and capture the dynamic changes of UHI through image fusion that considers resolution and spectrum. One potential idea is to include terrain or building footprint data into image fusion.\nThis course has given me a deep understanding that remote sensing is a vast interdisciplinary knowledge system. It is necessary to understand multiple subjects, such as optical mechanics, computer science, mathematics, geography, and meteorology, etc., which can better understand and apply remote sensing data. In addition, GEE and various sensor datasets have a high exploitability,allowing more exploration for preprocessing, analysis and technique development steps. I look forward to further applying remote sensing knowledge to my study and career in the future. :)"

    "text": "1.1 Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA)\nCompared to pixel-based supervised and unsupervised classification, OBIA aims to group pixels into objects, which are vector shapes with size and geometry (GISGeography,2024). Through the application of OBIA, the feature statistics of various objects, encompassing spectral, contextual, and shape features, can be captured to the fullest extent (Blaschke, 2010). Thus, the method connects raster EO data and vector data in the Geographic Information System ( Hay and Castilla,2008). As shown in Figure 1, OBIA consists of two main phases: (1) Image Segmentation Phase and (2) Post-segmentation Phase ( feature extraction and classification).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Segmentation steps of Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA). Picture source from TwEz-zahouani et al. (2023)\n\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that OBIA also has significant uncertainties in image processing. Hao, Cui and Wang (2021) indicate that the challenges have led to various issues, such as the selection of segmentation scale, training samples, and accuracy assessment, influencing the accuracy of image feature extraction. Therefore, we must carefully consider the segmentation methods we use when conducting OBIA.\n\nSimple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC)\n\nIn the lecture, the SLIC Algorithm is introduced as the common method of OBIA. SLIC is an adaptation of the k-means clustering algorithm for superpixel generation (Csillik, 2016). As the only parameter of the algorithm, K (the desired number of approximately equally sized superpixels) needs to be set, and superpixels are created by grouping nearby pixels with colour and spatial attributes proximity, considering the objects based on the similarity or difference of the pixels (Achanta et al.,2012). Regarding the working principle, the method adopts an algorithm that initiates from an initial rough pixel clustering and iteratively enhances the clusters until certain criteria are satisfied, ultimately forming superpixels(Csillik, 2016).\nRegarding the advantages of using SLIC, Achanta et al. (2012) indicate that SLIC surpasses current methods in computation speed, reducing computational complexity, memory efficiency, and boundary adherence, which can enhance the efficacy and quality of segmentation algorithms. However, Csillik (2017) illustrates the disadvantages of using superpixels and emphasises the need to carefully choose the size of superpixels: smaller superpixels can improve the geometric accuracy of objects but increase the computational time; larger superpixels ignore important boundaries and increase the internal heterogeneity of objects (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Comparing visualisation of superpixels captured by SLIC and SLICO(a free SLIC version). Picture source from Csillik (2017).\n\n\n\nLeft: 5 × 5 pixels, middle: 10 × 10 pixels, and right: 15 × 15 pixels."

Perez Machado and Small (2013) indicate that SMA improves image interpretability, as it considers the physical processes leading to the observed radiances (below pixel scale) and allows for the presence of mixed pixels. There are two methods of SMA, which are linear and nonlinear. In research, the linear ones are usually employed (Wu and Murray, 2003; Perez Machado and Small,2013), as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 The example of Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM).

For example, We can’t have both a high producer accuracy (recall) and a high user accuracy (precision).\n\n\n\nFigure 4 The equation of F1 score. Picture from MacLachlan (2024).\n\n\nF1_Score is a balance between precision and recall and takes a beta attribute that weights precision or recall (usually beta = 1) (Figure 4). The score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the model’s best output and 0 representing the model’s worst output.\n\n\n1.3.2 Kappa Coefficient\nThe Kappa coefficient is widely advocated and employed as a metric for assessing accuracy in remote sensing.\n\nIt is generated from a statistical measure to evaluate the accuracy of a classification.\nRange from 0 to 1\nHowever, Based on the research results. Foody(2020) indicates that the Kappa coefficient is flawed and/or irrelevant to the accuracy assessment of remote sensing classification."

Gao and Mas (2008) compared the classification results between OBIA and the pixel-based method using different spatial resolution satellite images. The results indicated that OBIA presented higher accuracies than pixel-based and demonstrated an advantage for processing higher-resolution images.

European Space Agency(ESA) has proposed the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission to observe earth by recording the wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imagery. The Sentinel-2 captures 13 spectral bands with different spatial resolutions.\nTo explore the features of spectral bands and their combinations, the data is resampled to 20m by considering the neighbouring pixels. Further, the bands are rearranged based on the band combinations provided by GISGeography , as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2 combines the red, green, and blue channels, reflecting an image similar to what the eye sees. The colour infrared adopts the near-infrared (B8) band to capture chlorophyll, showing healthier vegetation with darker red.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Sentinel Band Combinations: Natural Colour (B4,B3,B2)\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the eastern peninsula displays a large area of darker red, showing a dense vegetation coverage. In addition, the urbanised areas embody white and grey.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Sentinel Band Combinations: Colour Infrared (B8,B4,B3)\n\n\nFigure 4 embodies a combination for agriculture. Similar to Colour Infrared, B8 is employed to monitor vegetation health. Combined with the shortwave Infrared band (B11) being sensitive to moisture, this combination is beneficial for monitoring vegetation. Thus, the figure displays healthier and more hydrated vegetation with bright green. In addition to vegetation, B11 also provides information about surface features. It mainly reflects that the bare soil area in the northeast corner of Cape Town reflects a slight red element. Moreover, the urbanised area appears blue.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Sentinel Band Combinations: Agriculture (B11,B8,B2)"

    "text": "1.1 Landsat 8\nLandsat 8 provides data with high spatial resolution (30m) and temporal resolution (16 day). The advantage of using Landsat 8 to extract LST is that it has a thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) with thermal bands. Besides, Level 2 product provides the data after radiometric correction and atmospheric correction. Furthermore, the dataset contains land surface temperature, which can be calculated directly from band 10.\nDue to the geographical location and climatic conditions of Singapore, the availability of satellite images is significantly affected. To acquire more images, I set a relatively high cloud cover threshold (11%). Subsequently, I processed the images by converting temperature units from Kelvin to Celsius and removing any pixels that have below 0 values. Furthermore, the mean values were conducted to reduce the dimensionality. Finally, the image was clipped by boundaries vector data, shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 The LST Map extracted from Landsat 8.\n\n\nThe result clearly shows missing values in the northeast areas. This is likely due to the transformation of Band 10 into temperature, where values below 0 are considered missing. This could be influenced by factors such as sensor noise, cloud cover and pre-processing steps.\nIn Singapore, the areas with high LST are primarily concentrated in the three regions, which are the western gateway, where industrial areas are concentrated, the eastern aviation hub, and the central business district (CBD) in the south. These areas with high LST further reflect the urban fabric. In contrast, green and blue areas indicate lower LST, mainly presenting as blue and green colours."

Terra passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes from south to north in the afternoon. Therefore, MODIS has a higher temporal resolution, approximately 1-2 days. However, its thermal infrared bands have a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre, which is much higher than that of Landsat 8.\nBy scaling the data, merging data from Terra and Aqua, and calculating the average, the MODIS image of summer mean LST is demonstrated in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 The LST Map extracted from MODIS.\n\n\nIn terms of identification of low-temperature areas, MODIS is basically consistent with Landsat 8, but there are some differences in high-temperature areas.

Secondly, due to differences in spatial resolution, Landsat 8 can more accurately capture small-scale temperature changes, while MODIS may average temperatures over a larger range. Additionally, due to differences in temporal resolution, MODIS can more accurately capture temporal temperature changes, providing the LST results close to the ground situation."
