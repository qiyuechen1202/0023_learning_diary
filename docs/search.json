Several fundamental concepts on remote sensing are covered in the lecture, including the definitions, types, electromagnetic (EM) waves, energy interaction, and resolution. Next, I will employ Cape Town as an example to further understand and deepen this knowledge.\nRemote sensing provides multiple datasets, which create possibilities to explore urban studies. Exciting is the potential synergy between remote sensing data and socioeconomic indicators, presenting an avenue for exploring spatial heterogeneity. It may be included in my future research. However, The drawbacks also suggest that as a researcher of urban studies, I need to think carefully when using these data. This entails thoughtful decisions regarding the selection of remote sensing data, processing methods, analytical approaches, and result interpretation.\nIn my previous studies, I have focused on the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with vector data. Over the next few weeks, exploring the knowledge of remote sensing will allow me to integrate these two technologies, which can enhance my ability in data acquisition and spatial analysis. I am looking forward to learning about remote sensing in the coming weeks :)."

A study examining 450 GEE articles by Amani et al.(2020) summarised the primary scope of GEE applications (Figure 5), indicating that the GEE platform is mainly utilised in the fields of vegetation, agriculture, and hydrology category.\nIn terms of dataset application, Tamiminia et al. (2020) demonstrated, in a systematic review of 348 GEE articles, that 90% of GEE research adopted remote sensing datasets and conducted a series of Machine Learning, including classification, regression, and other methods (e.g. feature extraction) (Figure 6). The findings also revealed that Landsat (especially Landsat 8) and MODIS, as optical imagery with medium spatial resolution, were most popular in GEE studies. Taking the study of Xie et al. (2019) as an example, the time-series Landsat dataset was adopted on the GEE platform to monitor vegetation dynamics by calculating indices, and the GEE application significantly reduced the time and effort spent on data access, processing, and its storage cost. Xie et al.(2019) further mentioned that GEE can contribute to the efficient collaboration and sharing of scripts, allowing scholars to apply codes and access results easily and freely. Additionally, Tamiminia et al. (2020) also revealed that 10% of GEE studies analysed ready-to-use products, mainly focusing on vegetation indices, land cover, Hansen global forest change, and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). For instance, to capture cropland mapping of Africa, Xiong et al. (2017) applied the 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI composited data at 250-m resolution to develop the algorithm on GEE platform."

European Space Agency(ESA) has proposed the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission to observe earth by recording the wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imagery. The Sentinel-2 captures 13 spectral bands with different spatial resolutions.\nTo explore the features of spectral bands and their combinations, the data is resampled to 20m by considering the neighbouring pixels. Further, the bands are rearranged based on the band combinations provided by GISGeography ,as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Sentinel Band Combinations: Natural Colour (B4,B3,B2)\n\n\nFigure 2 combines the red, green, and blue channels, reflecting an image similar to what the eye sees. The colour infrared adopts the near-infrared (B8) band to capture chlorophyll, showing healthier vegetation with darker red.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Sentinel Band Combinations: Colour Infrared (B8,B4,B3)\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the eastern peninsula displays a large area of darker red, showing a dense vegetation coverage. In addition, the urbanised areas embody white and grey.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Sentinel Band Combinations: Agriculture (B11,B8,B2)\n\n\nFigure 4 embodies a combination for agriculture. Similar to Colour Infrared, B8 is employed to monitor vegetation health. Combined with shortwave Infrared band (B11) being sensitive to moisture, this combination is beneficial to monitoring vegetation. Thus, the figure displays healthier and more hydrated vegetation with more bright green. In addition to vegetation, B11 also provides information about surface features. It mainly reflects that the bare soil area in the northeast corner of Cape Town reflects a slight red element. Moreover, the urbanised area appears blue."

    "section": "2.1 Advantages",
    "text": "2.1 Advantages\nBased on its features of wide area coverage and repeated cycles, remote sensing can measure a regional or continental scale of urban environmental conditions and quantify changes in those conditions over time. The primary focus of this application lies in studying urban land cover and land use changes. The application is evident in the study of Wang et al.(2012), who adopted the Landsat TM/ETM+ to track China’s urban expansion from 1990 to 2010. Similarly, Zhou et al.(2018) explored the global urban dynamics from 1992 to 2013 using nighttime light (NTL) observations from DMSP/OLS. Furthermore, the Landsat dataset was also employed by Wang(2020) to predict land use and land cover changes in Kathmandu, Nepal. These studies underscore the feasibility of remote sensing for studying changes in land use and land cover at wide temporal and geographical scales.\nSecondly, remote sensing provides high-resolution imagery data, which is conducive to effectively identifying the elements of urban environments. The application is evident in the study of Qian et al.(2015), which examines the spatial pattern of green space and its changes in Beijing using satellite images with 2.5m spatial resolution, as shown in Figure(4). In addition, the QuickBird satellite provided very high-resolution imagery to the study of Kit, Lüdeke and Reckien(2012), which was employed to identify urban slums in Hyderabad, India.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Land cover classifications in 2005 and 2009. (source from Qian et al.,2015)\n\n\n\nThe images from 2005 and 2009 were obtained from Systeme Probatoire d’Observation dela Tarre(SPOT-5) and Advanced Land Observation Satellite(ALOS), respectively. The images were reprocessed to obtain multispectral images with 2.5 m spatial resolution.\n\nThere are two examples of the application in terms of observing human activities. Based on the two advantages mentioned above, remote sensing is considered as a supplementary tool for demographic, socioeconomic, and health investigations that are constrained in their geographical scope (Zhu et al., 2019). Regarding the social equity aspect, Kuffer et al. (2018) reported the disparity in access to street lighting between non-deprived built-up areas and slums by using NTL images and slum boundary data. In terms of public health, the Landsat-8 dataset and demographic distribution data were employed to assess the impact of urban heat islands on human health (Sagris and Sepp, 2017)."

    "text": "2.2 Disadvantages\nAlthough the advantages of remote sensing prove that it can be widely used in urban research, there are still drawbacks in its application. In their study of slums, Mahabir et al. (2018) state that remote sensing data can be used to identify the physical features of environments, while it is difficult to capture the characteristics of socioeconomic and cultural aspects. Thus, capturing a holistic understanding by integrating remote sensing data and socio-cultural datasets is essential. Besides, Bianchetti and MacEachren (2015) mentioned a misunderstanding that remote sensing images authoritatively and objectively represent the real world. However, the interpretation of remote sensing images requires analysts to draw on their knowledge, experience, and cognitive processes to obtain insights from the visual clues in the images, revealing the nature of subjectivity (White, 2019). Although scholars have adopted machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to interpret and classify remote sensing images, the complexity of this process has become a significant obstacle in its application to urban studies."

Heat island effect is a phenomenon that urban areas have a higher temperature than the surrounding area (Oke,1982). The primary reasons for the UHI effect is the greater heat storage due to land use change from natural to impervious surface(Grimmond, 2007). Besides, With the rise in urban population, the increases of building density and human activities also create more energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions(Zhang et al., 2021). In the terms of Singapore, daytime temperatures are around 0-2°C higher and night-time temperatures are around 2-4°C higher in urban areas compared to forested areas(Figure 1) (Urban Redevelopment Authority(URA),2023). The warmer climate has adverse impacts on biodiversity, public health, food security, energy consumption and other aspects, resulting in a unsustainable future in Singapore.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 The urban heat island effect in Singapor.

    "text": "2.2 “Cooling” Roofs\nGiven the high density and urbanisation rate in Singapore, making significant changes to the existing built environment is challenging. Thus, the adoption of “cooling” roofs has been recognized as a crucial strategy to address UHI effect in Singapore. Considering the significant influence of surface albedo on UHI, some scholars have explored solar reflective materials to alleviate this phenomenon (Despini et al., 2021). Using LANDSAT images of Chicago to compare albedo and Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), Mackey, Lee and Smith (2012) suggested that the reflective roofs show a more effective cooling effect than green items, such as green roofs, green spaces, and street trees. Besides, Taking the Municipality of Modena as a study area, Despini et al.( 2020) employed WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite images to obtain Surface Reflectance (SR) to calculate the average SR of different urban surfaces (Figure 7). Based on scenario predictions, the authors mentioned that the average temperature decreases by 1.2°C when cool materials on building roofs and cool coloured coatings on streets and parkings are applied.\n\n\n\nFigure7 The example of RGB images (left) and Albedo images(right) in Modena (source form Despini et al. (2021)\n\n\nMoreover, Mushore, Odindi and Mutanga (2022) examine the colour of roof coating by adopting Sentinel 2 and Landsat images. They distinguish the roof colour and then discuss their thermal effect in a low-density residential area of Zimbabwe, Harare. Figure 8 displays their outcomes, and Figure 8(b) indicates that the coolest roofs were blue and the warmest roofs were green and red. Overall, the studies cited above employed remote sensing data to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures on building roofs, which can be used to address the UHI effect in Singapore.\n\n\n\nFigure 8 Research results on low-density residential areas in Zimbabwe.(a)The land use and land cover map (left) and roof colour map (right).

The Local climate zone (LCZ) introduced by Stewart and Oke(2012) provides a new classification system of urban structure,which can be applied to detect local climate changes. By using machine learning to identify and classify urban satellite images,LCZs are categorised into 17 classes, namely 10 urban classes and 7 natural classes (Figure 3). The classification criteria are diverse and can be adjusted according to the geographical characteristics of the study area. Based on the summary of Stewart and Oke(2012) the classification criteria mainly include 4 aspects, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 The Classification of Local Climate Zones (Source from Bechtel,et al.(2017) and Stewart and Oke(2012))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 The Classification Criteria of Local Climate Zones (Source from Stewart and Oke(2012))\n\n\nThe heat island effect on LCZs is mainly examined by combining the Land Surface Temperature(LST), which can be reflected in the research of authors Yang et al.(2021) and Xu et al.(2022). Initially, remote sensing data were distinguished using classification indicators, and machine learning methods were applied for supervised classification of remote sensing images to discern various categories of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) （Figure 5). Subsequently, the authors acquired LST data through processing remote sensing dataset and analysed the differentiated LST displayed by different types of LCZs.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 The RS-based LCZs Map of Guangzhou City (Source from Xu et al.(2022))\n\n\nBased on the analysis of summer average LST in Liaoning Province, China (Figure 6), Yang et al.(2021) proposed that LCZE (bare rock and paved) are more likely to increase LST, while LCZA(Dense trees) and LCZG(water) are more likely to decrease LST, aligning with the study of Guangzhou by Xu et al. (2022). In addition, regarding the urban classes of LCZs, Yang et al. (2022) suggested that higher numbers of summer LSTs occur in LCZ 2(compact mid-rise) and LCZ10(heavy industry).On the contrary, Xu et al.(2022) indicated that LCZ 3 (compact low-rise) and LCZ 8 (large low-rise) are the areas with the most severe thermal impact, further proving that there is heterogeneity in the effect of urban space on LST.\n\n\n\nFigure 6 The LCZs box plot with LST in Liaoning Province,China, 2017 and 2019(Source from Yang et al.(2021))\n\n\nTo promote green town programmes, Singapore can adopt LCZs to identify the urban morphology with higher and lower thermal impact and conduct urban regeneration. Moreover, the LCZs method can also be applied to long-term monitoring for seasons, which can further propose prevention strategies for thermal impacts."

The classification criteria are diverse and can be adjusted according to the geographical characteristics of the study area. Based on the summary of Stewart and Oke(2012) the classification criteria mainly include 4 aspects, as shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 The Classification of Local Climate Zones (Source from Bechtel,et al.(2017) and Stewart and Oke(2012))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 The Classification Criteria of Local Climate Zones (Source from Stewart and Oke(2012))\n\n\nThe heat island effect on LCZs is mainly examined by combining the Land Surface Temperature(LST), which can be reflected in the research of authors Yang et al.(2021) and Xu et al.(2022). Initially, remote sensing data were distinguished using classification indicators, and machine learning methods were applied for supervised classification of remote sensing images to discern various categories of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) （Figure 5). Subsequently, the authors acquired LST data through processing remote sensing dataset and analysed the differentiated LST displayed by different types of LCZs.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 The RS-based LCZs Map of Guangzhou City (Source from Xu et al.(2022))\n\n\nBased on the analysis of summer average LST in Liaoning Province, China (Figure 6), Yang et al.(2021) proposed that LCZE (bare rock and paved) are more likely to increase LST, while LCZA(Dense trees) and LCZG(water) are more likely to decrease LST, aligning with the study of Guangzhou by Xu et al. (2022). In addition, regarding the urban classes of LCZs, Yang et al. (2022) suggested that higher numbers of summer LSTs occur in LCZ 2(compact mid-rise) and LCZ10(heavy industry).On the contrary, Xu et al.(2022) indicated that LCZ 3 (compact low-rise) and LCZ 8 (large low-rise) are the areas with the most severe thermal impact, further proving that there is heterogeneity in the effect of urban space on LST.\n\n\n\nFigure 6 The LCZs box plot with LST in Liaoning Province,China, 2017 and 2019(Source from Yang et al.(2021))\n\n\nTo promote green town programmes, Singapore can adopt LCZs to identify the urban morphology with higher and lower thermal impact and conduct urban regeneration. Moreover, the LCZs method can also be applied to long-term monitoring for seasons, which can further propose prevention strategies for thermal impacts."
